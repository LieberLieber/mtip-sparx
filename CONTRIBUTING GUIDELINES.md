# Contributing Guidelines

## Contributing to MTIP â€“ Sparx Enterprise Architect Plugin

We value your contributions and suggestions! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue. Make sure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under issues.

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code. Reports should include (not required):

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code, HUDS XML example, and model example links if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## We Use GitHub Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
    1. Prefix the branch with "feature/" for new features.
    2. Prefix the branch with "bugfix/" for bugfixes.
2. Note if any extensions, references, packages, etc were added for your changes.
3. If you've added code provide extensive details on what features were changed, added, or removed
4. Ensure changes work as described.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Tests

We have not developed any standardized testing. Any help with this is greatly appreciated.
